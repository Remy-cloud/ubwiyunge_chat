	•	Description of the concept of their Mission; 

Our Mission 
"To empower Rwandan citizens with direct digital access to their local leaders, fostering transparent governance and accountable public service delivery that strengthens democratic participation at all administrative levels." 

Relevance to Rwanda's Governance Sector & Regional Integration 

	•	Strengthening Local Democracy: Enhances Rwanda's decentralization policy by empowering citizens to actively engage with Cell, Sector, and District leaders 
	•	Improves Accountability: Creates transparent tracking of issues and government responses, supporting Rwanda's high governance rankings Advances 
	•	Digital Governance: Complements e-governance initiatives like Irembo, supporting Rwanda's Digital Transformation Strategy
	•	Problem statement: 
Background 
Rwanda's remarkable transformation since 1994 has been built on strong governance principles and citizen participation. The country's decentralization policy, implemented to bring government closer to the people, established a four-tier administrative structure from Provinces down to Cells, with local leaders responsible for addressing community needs. However, as Rwanda advances its digital transformation agenda and citizens become increasingly connected through mobile technology, traditional communication methods between citizens and their local leaders have not kept pace. While Rwanda excels in national-level e-governance through platforms like Irembo, a significant gap exists in facilitating direct communication between citizens and their immediate local leaders who handle day-to-day community issues.
The Problem Statement:

Rwanda's citizens lack direct digital access to local leaders, with 70% of community issues never reaching appropriate authorities despite high mobile penetration, creating unresolved problems and effective public service delivery (NISR, 2023; World Bank Digital Development Report, 2024).

	•	World Bank. (2024). Digital Development Report: Building Trust in Digital Government Services

Software Development Model: 
Agile Development with Scrum Framework 
	•	Methodology: Iterative development with 2-week sprints 
	•	Rationale: Enables continuous stakeholder feedback from citizens and leaders, accommodates changing governance requirements, and reduces project risks through early delivery
	•	Framework: Scrum ceremonies including sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives 
	•	Timeline: 4 phases over weeks beyond week 12, from foundation to deployment


The Hypothesis of Their Solution 

Core Hypothesis: 
"By deploying a mobile-first digital platform connecting citizens with local leaders, we will achieve a 60% citizen adoption rate and 50% reduction in issue resolution time within 12 months of national launch, measurably improving governance transparency and citizen satisfaction by 40% across Rwanda's 30 districts."

6.SDLC MODEL
Choice of Development Methodology 
Agile Development with Scrum Framework 
	•	Enables continuous stakeholder feedback from citizens and leaders 
	•	Accommodates changing governance requirements during development 
	•	Reduces project risks through iterative delivery and early testing 
Development Phases and Milestones 
Phase 1: Foundation - User authentication, basic UI, and database setup complete Phase 2: Core Features - Issue management, leader directory, and response system operational Phase 3: Enhanced Features - Community engagement, multi-language support, and analytics implemented Phase 4: Deployment - Complete testing, security audit, and production-ready system delivered (weeks beyond week 12)
